You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: \nThis will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question.\nAsk him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving.\nProvide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\nAnd don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'pydub', 'csv', 'pandas', 'torch', 're', 'math', 'datetime', 'time', 'scipy', 'requests', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'pubchempy', 'stat', 'numpy', 'os', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'json', 'fractions', 'PIL', 'chess', 'random', 'sympy', 'statistics', 'pptx']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old.

You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: \nThis will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question.\nAsk him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving.\nProvide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\nAnd don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'pydub', 'csv', 'pandas', 'torch', 're', 'math', 'datetime', 'time', 'scipy', 'requests', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'pubchempy', 'stat', 'numpy', 'os', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'json', 'fractions', 'PIL', 'chess', 'random', 'sympy', 'statistics', 'pptx']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!

If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.\n\n\n\nNow here is the team member's final answer deducted from the above:\n### 1. Search outcome (short version):\nThe commonly used chemicals for virus testing of Sweet Potato Feathery Mottle Virus (SPFMV) and Sweet Potato Chlorotic Streak Virus (SPCSV) include inhibitors targeting the CSR3 enzyme, which is an RNA silencing suppressor. Five specific compounds have been identified that inhibit CSR3 activity and reduce viral accumulation in plants.\n\n### 2. Search outcome (extremely detailed version):\nIn the study titled \"In Vitro Identification and In Vivo Confirmation of Inhibitors for Sweet Potato Chlorotic Stunt Virus RNA Silencing Suppressor, a Viral RNase III,\" researchers conducted high-throughput screening (HTS) of small molecular libraries to identify potential inhibitors of the CSR3 enzyme encoded by SPCSV. The screening process involved virtual docking of over 136,000 compounds, which led to the selection of 6,400 candidates. Further kinetic-based HTS isolated 112 compounds, which were validated through various assays, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology and binding affinity assays.\n\nUltimately, the study identified five compounds belonging to two structural classes that effectively inhibited CSR3 activity and reduced viral accumulation in infected plants. These findings suggest that these compounds could serve as potential antiviral agents for controlling sweetpotato virus diseases caused by SPCSV and SPFMV.\n\n### 3. Additional context:\nSweet potato virus disease (SPVD) is a significant agricultural issue caused by the synergistic infection of SPCSV and SPFMV, leading to yield losses of up to 90%. The CSR3 enzyme plays a crucial role in this process by suppressing the plant's RNA silencing defense mechanism, making it an ideal target for antiviral drug development. While the specific names of the five identified compounds were not extracted during this search, they represent promising candidates for further research and development in combating viral infections in sweetpotato crops.\n\nFor further details, you can access the full article [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8315922/) for comprehensive insights into the methodologies and findings related to these inhibitors.\n"}, {"llm_output": "Thought: I have gathered information regarding the commonly used chemicals for virus testing of SPFMV and SPCSV, particularly focusing on inhibitors of the CSR3 enzyme.

This information can typically be found in scientific literature, virology textbooks, or databases such as PubMed or Google Scholar.\n- **EC numbers**: Once we identify the inhibitors, we need to find their corresponding Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. This information can be found in databases like the BRENDA database or the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature website.\n- **Specific studies on SPFMV and SPCSV**: We should look for any specific studies or reviews that detail the inhibitors used in testing for these viruses. This can be found in virology journals or specialized articles on plant virology.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- **List of inhibitors and their EC numbers**: After gathering the inhibitors and their corresponding EC numbers, we will compile a list that includes both the common inhibitors and their EC numbers.\n- **Contextual understanding of the inhibitors' mechanisms**: We may want to derive information about how these inhibitors work in the context of SPFMV and SPCSV testing, including their effectiveness and any relevant studies that detail their use.

If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.\n\n\n\nNow here is the team member's final answer deducted from the above:\n### 1. Search outcome (short version):\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find the EC numbers for the compounds FIMM022230, FIMM005536, FIMM051696, FIMM000096, and FIMM031755. Searches across various databases, including the ECHA EC Inventory and the Expasy ENZYME database, did not yield the required information.\n\n### 2. Search outcome (extremely detailed version):\n- **FIMM022230**: Multiple searches were conducted, but no specific EC number was found for this compound. The ECHA EC Inventory and Expasy ENZYME database were consulted without success.\n  \n- **FIMM005536**: Similar to the previous compound, searches did not yield any results. The same databases were referenced, but the EC number remains elusive.\n\n- **FIMM051696**: The search for this compound also produced no results. The same resources were checked, and no EC number was identified.\n\n- **FIMM000096**: Again, searches did not return an EC number. The resources previously used were consulted without success.\n\n- **FIMM031755**: The search for the final compound yielded no results as well. The same databases were explored, but no EC number was found.\n\nOverall, the repeated searches across established databases such as ECHA and Expasy did not provide any useful information regarding the EC numbers for these compounds. \n\n### 3.

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_action>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_action>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\n\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\n\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\npopulation_guangzhou = search(\"Guangzhou population\")\nprint(\"Population Guangzhou:\", population_guangzhou)\npopulation_shanghai = search(\"Shanghai population\")\nprint(\"Population Shanghai:\", population_shanghai)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_action>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `search` to get the age of the pope, then raise it to the power 0.36.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age = search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age:\", pope_age)\n```<end_action>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 85 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 85 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 85 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_action>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have acces to those tools:\n\n\n- ask_search_agent: \nThis will send a message to a team member that will browse the internet to answer your question.\nAsk him for all your web-search related questions, but he's unable to do problem-solving.\nProvide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\nAnd don't hesitate to provide them with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n\n    Takes inputs: {'query': {'description': \"Your question, as a natural language sentence with a verb! You are talking to an human, so provide them with as much context as possible! DO NOT ASK a google-like query like 'paper about fish species 2011': instead ask a real sentence like: 'What appears on the last figure of a paper about fish species published in 2011?'\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': 'the question to answer', 'type': 'text'}, 'image_path': {'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.', 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'text'}, 'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR A WEBPAGE: use the search tool instead!\", 'type': 'text'}}\n\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'text', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n\nYou also can perform computations in the Python code that you generate.\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_action>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = ask_search_agent({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = ask_search_agent(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs might derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['queue', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'yahoo_finance', 'collections', 'pydub', 'csv', 'pandas', 'torch', 're', 'math', 'datetime', 'time', 'scipy', 'requests', 'sklearn', 'xml', 'pubchempy', 'stat', 'numpy', 'os', 'itertools', 'bs4', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'Bio', 'json', 'fractions', 'PIL', 'chess', 'random', 'sympy', 'statistics', 'pptx']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up!
